            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>Barber Motorsports Park is the result of one man's single-minded determination to create a world-class venue to showcase his unprecedented collection of motorcycles: George Barber. The sometime racer amassed a fortune from property investments and the family dairy business and decided to plough it into the facility near his home in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>Barber was an accomplished Porsche racer in the 1960s and early '70s before the demands of running the family business took hold. His firm had specialised in refurbishing and refitting the trucks in its fleet and before long, Barber asked them to look at restoring cars. These early results were disappointing – in Barber's words: "Perfect to a truck mechanic is not the same as to a restorer" – but a friend suggested motorcycles might be a better bet. Soon, Barber had amassed a small collection and began to wonder if it might be possible to create the biggest collection in the word, at the same time creating a tourist attraction for his beloved home city.</p><p>By the mid-1990s, he was well on the way to fulfilling the dream, having amassed a large private collection. In 1994, he established a non-profit foundation, separate from his business ventures, and a year later the facility opened to the public as a museum, with 325 motorcycles from around the world and a few vintage cars on display. The building – a warehouse in Birmingham's Southside neighbourhood – also housed a library and fabrication, fibreglass, paint, and machine shops. The total collection exceeded 500 at the time, and the foundation began searching for a site to create a larger facility.</p><p>When Barber Dairies was sold to the Illinois-based Dean Foods Company in 1998, George took his opportunity to finalise his dream, donating $54 million to the foundation to allow it to build a new museum and a road course on which to run the collection. By 2002, a 740-acre site in the rolling hills just east of downtown Birmingham was selected and renowned course designer Alan Wilson hired to draw up the plans for the circuit.</p><p>Completed to Barber's exacting standards, the 16-turn circuit features an undulating layout which winds its way through a wooded park. Two shorter alternative layouts can also be utilised. The compact layout is unusual on a number of fronts; the paddock area sits on multiple tiered levels and there are no spectator viewing facilities immediately next to the start/finish straight. Instead, the main spectator area is along the back stretch, between turns 8 and 11; here race-goers can watch from embankments or from temporary grandstands erected for event weekends. Most of the course is viewable from these areas, while additional spectator sections are available outside of turns 2, 3 and 14.</p><p>One of the more unique features of the circuit is the sculpture trail that can be found dotted around the site. Large in scale, they provide an amusing backdrop to racing, featuring as they do giant spiders, dragonflies, a pair of lions and a Sisyphean figure pushing a boulder. The presence of the large spider sculpture alongside Turns 5/6 has lead to this section of track being nicknamed 'Charlotte's Web'.</p><p>Next to the circuit, and with its own access between turns 8 and 9, sits the impressive museum building. Covering five floors and with 141,000 square feet it houses the expanded collection of 1,200 motorcycles, up to 600 of which are on public display at any on time – certified by Guinness as the largest museum of its type in the world. In addition, the facility houses the largest collection of Lotus race cars in the world, from a replica of the rare Mark 1 all the way through to the final F1 car, the T109. Nearly all are ready to run at a moment's notice and are regularly demonstrated at the track.</p><p>Perhaps inevitably, the first racing events focused on motorcycles, with the AMA and WERA series both becoming regular visitors. Gradually, car racing was introduced, first through Grand Am races and more latterly, the Indycar Series has added Barber to its schedule following several successful tests in 2007 and 2009. The circuit also serves as the home of the Porsche Driving Experience, Kevin Schwantz Suzuki School, Keith Code California Superbike School and the Jamie James Yamaha Champions Riding School.</p></div>

            LE MANS BUGATTI CIRCUIT
            <img src="https://www.racingcircuits.info/assets/components/phpthumbof/cache/Le-Mans-Bugatti-15.06b302f191deea10b80b5e34630ee202.png" width="95%">
            <div style="font-size: 20px"><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.6 Miles &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Turns:</strong> 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Race lap record:</strong> 1:06.6001 (Sebastien Bourdais, 2016 IndyCar)</div><a href="https://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/france/le-mans.html#.YCKQyWjYq00" style="font-size: 20px;">RacingCircuits.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lemans.org/" style="font-size: 20px;">Official Website</a><br><br><div style="font-size: 45px">Description</div>
            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>As early as the 1950s, talk began about creating a permanent circuit inside the main 24 Hours course. The costs - and inconvenience of the closure of public roads - limited the use of the full course and there was increasing pressure from local racers and teams for a facility that could be used year-round. It wasn't until 1964 that the project that would create the Bugatti Circuit got the go-ahead and Charles Deutsch began designing a layout to take advantage of the wooded area to the rear of the main paddock. Supposedly inspired by the silhouette of his left hand, he created a 4.422 km serpentine layout which had the benefit of making use of the 24 Hour circuit's pits, paddock and grandstand facilities.</p><p>Just after the Dunlop bridge and part way along the descent towards Tertre Rouge, the new Bugatti course turned right through a tight hairpin and ran parallel to the main course back towards the paddock village area. The then newly-constructed Musée des 24 Heures buildings necessitated the creation of a wide parabolic curve, which turned the course back through more than 180° and onto a new straight to the eastern-most point of the available land. From there another hairpin led onto a long straight with a kink in the middle - the Chemin aux Bœufs - followed by a series of S-bends and yet another hairpin which rejoined the main course just before the pits.</p><p>Construction began in the winter of 1964 and was completed by April 1965, aided by the sandy ground helping drain away any rainfall during the construction. Named in honour of Ettore Bugatti, the 2.7 mile course was a modern, if slightly sterile, course but did at least feature the best of contemporary safety measures - though primitive by modern standards, amounting as it did to earth banks, wooden palisades and half-buried tyres as corner markers.</p><p>Just two years after its first race, the Bugatti Circuit hosted its one and only Formula One event, with the 1967 French Grand Prix being won by Jack Brabham. "Characterless" was the rather harsh opinion of some drivers, while the meaner American hacks coined the term "Mickey Mouse" circuit. A crowd of just 20,000 turned out to watch and the experiment was never repeated.</p><p>Bike racers took to the track more readily and in 1969 it hosted its first World Championship event, with the 500cc class being won by Giacamo Agostini, a feat he repeated the following year. Thereafter throughout the 1970s and '80s, the Grand Prix was shared between Le Mans, Nogaro, Paul Ricard, Clermont-Ferrand and Magny-Cours, before Le Mans was made its permanent home in 2000.</p><p>Other high profile two-wheeled events include a 24 Hour race and the Bol D'Or Endurance event and the majority of the subsequent changes to the circuit have made due to safety improvements required by the FIM.</p><p>In 1976 the Garage Vert hairpin was reprofiled and squared off to provide additional run off room. The original sand trap was too short and there were numerous occasions where racers would slam into - and sometimes over - the earth bank when things went wrong. The new squared off double apex corner was nothing to write home about.</p><p>In common with the main course, 1987 saw the debut of the Dunlop Chicane, while a new 'S' bend was inserted at Chemin aux Boeufs corner, with a realigned straight leading into the final corners at the request of the FIM. The old straight remains in place for those who overshoot the first of the new bends! Two years later came more changes, when the Garage Bleu esses and the final corner were re-profiled, again to create better run off and in preparation for the new pit buildings that were soon to follow. The circuit now fed back onto the main course at the second of the Ford chicanes.</p><p>Aside from the various changes to the first corner and Dunlop chicane in common with the main course, the next major change to the Bugatti layout came in 2000, when La Musée corner was tightened and move further infield to create a much extended run off. Next came the major revisions to the Virage de Chapelle in 2002, further changes to the first corner and Dunlop Chicane in 2006 and most recently in 2008, Garage Vert corner was re-profiled for a second time, creating a straighter exit towards Chemin aux Boeufs.</p><p>Activity at the circuit went on for around 90 days of the year back in 1970. By the end of the 1990s, it reached 330 days per annum easily and today it is one of the busiest circuits in Europe. Aside from the Grand Prix, the Bugatti layout currently hosts the French Superbikes, its own 24 Hour races for bikes and trucks, a VW festival and the V de V Endurance Series.</p></div>
