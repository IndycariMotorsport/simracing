            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>Motor racing first came to Detroit's Belle Isle in 1992, moving across the river from a bumpy and largely unpopular course which wound around the Renaissance Center.   While the concrete canyons which greeted first Formula One and Indycar drivers in downtown Detroit were still present on Belle Isle, the new course did at least offer better viewing facilities for spectators and TV audiences alike.  Teams were slightly less impressed with paddock facilities, which could turn into a muddy mess in inclement weather, while drivers found a tight and twisty course which offered few opportunities to pass.</p><p>Shortcomings aside, the Detroit Grand Prix established a firm place on the CART calendar, with Roger Penske promoting the events.  The initial course stretched for 2.1 miles around the existing parkland roads and was used until 1997.  For the 1998 event, an extended straight took the cars further down Central Avenue to a newly-built link road, which returned to the original course at the old Turn 7 (though approaching from the opposite direction).   This opened up a new and much-needed overtaking opportunity, though passing still remained a tricky proposition.  This layout was used by the CART series up to 2001, after which the event died away with Penske's switch of codes to the then all-oval Indy Racing League.</p><p>Racing engines fell silent on the island for the next six years, but in 2007, the race was once-again revived for a double header weekend featuring the now unified Indycar Series and the Amercian Le Mans Series.  As with the following year's event, the race once again utilised the shorter original course, the link road having fallen into relative disrepair in the intervening years, while Turn nine had also been modified to create a tighter and slower entry.  A 2009 event was scheduled, but eventually cancelled, a victim of the downturn in the Detroit automotive industry and the city's economic struggles.</p><p>Roger Penske always remained open to the idea of racing making a return to the Island and, after a four year hiatus, the Indycars returned, this time in partnership with the Grand-Am Series.  Proceeds from the event have been used to fund improvements to the facilities on Belle Isle. Once again, the short course was utilised in 2012, with a sealed-surface paddock area the only major change.  A resurfaced link road allowed for the use of the longer course once more from 2013 onwards.</p><p>The island itself has a much longer history beyond that of the Grand Prix.  Covering 982-acres in the centre of the Detroit River between the city and Windsor, Canada, it was first settled by French colonists in the 18th century, who named it Île aux Cochons (Hog Island).  It gained its present name in 1845, possibly in recognition of physician Henry Bélisle.</p><p>Landscaped in the 1880s by Frederick L. Olmsted, the highlights of Belle Isle are the aquarium (the oldest such facility in the USA, having first opened in 1904), the Scott Fountain and the botanical garden in the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory. The conservatory and the 1908 Belle Isle Casino were constructed by Detroit architect Albert Kahn, well-known for developing open-floor plan concrete factories. The casino building is no longer a gambling facility, but it is used for public events. Belle Isle also was home to a large herd of European fallow deer for more than 50 years. A few remain as exhibits at the nature center, but the last of the 300 animals was captured in 2004 and relocated.</p><p>Various entities beside the Grand Prix call Belle Isle home, including the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, the Detroit Boat Club Crew, the Detroit Yacht Club, a municipal golf course, an aquarium and a Coast Guard post.</p></div>

            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>The Homestead-Miami Speedway owes its existence to a natural disaster; building the circuit was a key part of plans to help the city of Homestead rebound after the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew.</p><p>Longtime Miami motorsports promoter Ralph Sanchez struck a deal to build the 434-acre facility and groundbreaking began August 24, 1993, exactly one year after the hurricane. Sanchez had considerable experience of promoting successful sportscar events at the Bicentennial Park temporary course and, in the runup to the new oval opening, a further Indycar race was organised on the street circuit to help build interest among local fans.</p><p>The track opened in November 1995 as a four-turn, rectangular-oval, based on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's layout. The first event was the Jiffy Lube Miami 300, the last round of the NASCAR Busch Series. After a ceremonial ribbon cutting, sold out crowds watched Dale Jarrett race to victory. CART Indycars debuted the following spring, Jimmy Vasser taking victory in what was to be a championship year for the American driver.</p><p>The new facility was a colourful addition to the racing scene, thanks to its brightly painted buildings and walls, which mirrored the aqua, purple and silver art deco style of old Miami. But there was a significant problem; the racing, in truth, wasn't very good. The Indianapolis-style four cornered layout didn't scale well down to Homestead's smaller size. Instead, the sharp, flat turns and aprons made passing difficult and lowered overall speed. There were also concerns as to the crash angles that the geometry created.</p><p>In a bid to correct these problems, in 1996 the aprons of the turns were widened by as much as 24 feet (7.3m), but this did little to significantly improve the racing. Tragedy followed during the 1997 Craftsman Truck race when John Nemechek, younger brother of NASCAR races winner Joe Nemechek, died following a collision at Turn One. Following the collision, $8.2 million was spent in the summer of 1997 to tear down the corners and turn the course to a more traditional continuous-turn oval with six-degree banking. Amid emotional scenes, Joe Nemechek ran out the winner on the remodelled course in the Busch Series race that November.</p><p>Track action wasn't, however, simply confined to the oval; from the outset, Homestead had benefited from a European-style road course within the oval infield. This did not use any part of the oval banking, so was unaffected by the 1997 remodelling. While perhaps not having the challenge of a Road America or Laguna Seca, it did nevertheless draw favour from many drivers.</p><p>The road course also drew some early (and unusual for a US circuit) international attention, when the FIA GT Series paid a visit in both 1998 and 1999. Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta took victory in 1998 in the mighty Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM, while the following years race, run to GT2 regulations, saw the works Chrysler team beaten for the only time that year when Paul Belmondo and Emmanuel Clérico took victory in their private Chrysler Viper GTS-R. Since those early days, the road course has settled into hosting Grand-Am events until 2013 and more recently the Trans-Am series.  In both cases, a new road course configuration using the banking and bypassing the final section of the original road course has been used.</p><p>In 2003, the second major rebuilding programme of the oval course commenced, with a $12 million re-banking project that transforms the track from a flat 6-degrees to a computer-designed 18-to-20-degree variable banking system in the turns. The renovations were praised by fans, and the track has produced a number of close finishes. In 2005 night lighting was also installed and Turn One tower opened, housing the Champions Club premium-seating level and private suites.</p><p>Sadly, two more fatalities have been recorded at the track since its reconfiguration; Indycar driver Paul Dana suffered fatal injuries in the warmup session before the 2005 race, when he was involved in a high-speed collision after being unable to avoid the crashed car of Ed Carpenter. Then in 2007 Jeff Clinton died in practice for a Grand Am sports car event when his car overturned at Turn One of the road course. In neither case was the track configuration a factor.</p><p>A new 18,000 square-foot, two-story media facility was completed in October 2008, while the following year saw a state-of-the-art new scoring tower added, complete with LED displays providing high-resolution graphics and easy-to-view statistical information.</p></div>
