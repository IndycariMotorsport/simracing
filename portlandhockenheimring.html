            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>The racing circuit at Portland owes its existence to an unhappy chapter in Oregon's history, being built on the site of a city destroyed by flooding.</p><p>The city of Vanport was hastily built by Henry Kaiser in 1942 to house World War Two shipyard workers. Buildings went up quickly and soon Vanport had a population of more than 40,000, making it the the second largest city in the state of Oregon at that time and the largest public housing project in the nation.</p><p>Nestling between the contemporary Portland city limits and the Columbia River on reclaimed lowlands, Vanport was protected by a system of dykes which held the waters back. Tragically, after a weeks of heavy rains, the dykes failed at 4.17pm on Memorial Day, May 30, 1948. A 10-feet high wall of water rushed in killing 15 people and within half an hour the entire city was underwater. When the waters eventually receded, a picture of complete devastation emerged, with virtually all buildings destroyed and no prospect of the remainder being habitable. After the debris was cleared away, the city was abandoned.</p><p>In 1960, the city of Portland purchased the land from the Army Corps of Engineers for $175,000. It did not take long for racing enthusiasts to see the potential of the land and, a year later, the first races were held along the abandoned roads. The Portland Rose Festival Association was persuaded to sponsor the race and the Rose Cup was born, with its first running in June 1961. The race has been an important part of the Rose Festival ever since.</p><p>The original circuit began on the remains of Cottonwood Street, with a temporary paddock area on the opposite side to the modern facility. The main straight was also used as a popular drag strip. The circuit then turned right to follow the former Lake Avenue before turning right again onto Victory Boulevard, taking in the junction with Force Avenue before resuming along the same back stretch that is still in use today. The final series of turns, known as 'the Circus' to racers of the day, rounded off the lap.</p>
<p>Changes were made to the final turns in the mid-60s, leaving the with a layout similar to today, but the first major alteration came in 1969 when the track was shortened to 1.8 miles by using Force Avenue as turn one, rather than Lake Ave. At the same time Cottonwood Street was repaved as a 1/8 mile drag strip.</p><p>By the dawn of the next decade it was becoming clear that racing through the old city roads, with its numerous hazards, was becoming too dangerous. Racers leaving the track unexpectedly could collide with leftover concrete foundations or even find themselves driving into ponds or the water sloughs which were still a feature of the area. The major sanctioning bodies began refusing to hold races at West Delta Park and plans were formulated to convert the course into a permanent facility.</p><p>The diggers moved in April 1971 and, alongside a complete repaving, the Force Avenue portion of the course was extensively reconfigured, with a series of sweeping curves replacing the previous straight. Armco barrier was also installed around the track, while the shut down area of the drag strip was increased, to allow for quarter mile drag racing. In addition, the staging lanes/pre grid area and the return road along the drag strip were paved. For road racing, the pit lane was formed in the staging area of the drag strip. The first major race on the reconfigured Portland International Raceway was the Rose Festival Drags on June 5/6, followed by the Rose Cup Races on June 12/13.</p>
<p>Funded by a $100,000 loan arranged by the Rose Festival Association from four banks, all of the monies were paid back by 1973 and the facility has operated as a commercial enterprise ever since, generating a profit for the City of Portland and meaning it requires zero funding by the taxpayer. Popular events during these years included the annual visit of the IMSA sportscars.</p><p>In 1984, the track underwent some $800,000 worth of improvements. The most noticeable change to the track itself was the addition of a chicane (known as the 'Festival Curves') toward the end of the main straight/drag strip, while a permanent pit lane and paved paddock area was installed for the first time on the infield. Elsewhere, Victory Boulevard was widened and concrete barriers and debris fencing were installed along the inside of its entire length. The final turn was also repaved and widened near the new pit entry road. This required removing 150 feet of existing guardrail. The entire front straight/dragstrip (Cottonwood Street) was also repaved at this time. These changes increased the track length to 1.967 miles.</p><p>The changes propelled PIR into a new league, allowing the introduction of CART Indycar racing for the first time. The Grand Prix of Portland quickly became a headline attraction for the track, which soon became a favourite among the drivers. Close races were common and the track played host to the smallest ever winning margin on a road course in 1986, when Michael Andretti ran out of fuel on the final lap, allowing father Mario to catch up and nip by him at the line to win by just 0.070 seconds. That margin would stand as an all-time record until 1997, when the circuit witnessed the closest two-car and closest three-car finish. Mark Blundell beat second-placed Gil de Ferran by 0.027 seconds and third-placed Raul Boesel by 0.055 second, in a thrilling three-wide finish.</p><p>By 1992, the speed of the CART racers need to be slowed and the Festival Curves were reconfigured into a much tighter chicane, paved in concrete. It was perhaps not the most elegant solution and the Festival curves were again modified for the 2005 season, with the second turn widened and made faster to try and alleviate the traditional first lap pile-up.</p><p>In 2008 PIR went through a track renovation, with a complete repaving with new asphalt and reconfiguration of Turns 4 to 7. The fence on the inside of turn 6 was moved to provide a better sight-line through the corner, while Turn 7 was sharpened to slow down racers prior to entering the back straight. FIA-specification curbing was also installed around the track which opened in its new form on February 23, 2008, with a ribbon cutting ceremony.</p><p>The unification of the Champcar and Indycar championships in 2008 left no room on the calendar for Portland and, with the departure of the ALMS two years previously, the circuit was left with the prospect of no headline events. A new top-category event was found however, in the form of the NASCAR K&N West Series, which made Portland an annual stop until 2013, after which the circuit was left with a calendar comprising only of local races for the ICSCC, SCCA and OMRRA championships. Diversifying, the track now also hosts bicycle races while a popular winter event sees the entire circuit festooned with festive lights, creating a drive-though 'winter wonderland' in the run-up to Christmas each year.</p>
<p>Should the major domestic championships decide on a return to the Pacific north west, PIR will be well placed to receive them once more but until then, the circuit looks set to continue profitably as something of a hidden gem.</p></div>

            <div style="font-size: 14px"><p>The German town of Hockenheim has become synonymous with motor racing thanks to its famous circuit, which has transformed from a high-speed blast through the forests to a thoroughly modern autodrome.</p><p>The origins of the circuit began with a conversation in 1930 between timekeeper Ernst Christ and his young assistant, who suggested putting on a race in their home town of Hockenheim. Taken with the idea, Christ took the idea to the mayor, Philipp Klein, and (appropriately) on Christmas Day 1931, the municipal council unanimously approved the plans for the new circuit.</p><p>Building work began on March 23, 1932, and only two months later on May 25 the first motorcycle race in Hockenheim got under way. For this small town, it marked the beginning of a long association with motor sport.</p><p>The essentially triangular course began on the edge of the town and headed out into the forest roads, before looping back on itself. Just six years later, in 1938, the circuit was fundamentally changed. The triangular course was modified with the inclusion of a fast curve at its eastern end, known as the Ostkurve. The familiar oval-shape now emerged and was to be a feature of the layout for the next 63 years.</p><p>The new layout was also christened with a new name; <em>Kurpfalzring.</em>  The straights were widened and given  a sealed surface for the first time, while wooden grandstands and other spectator facilities sprung up. The gradual change from a temporary course to a permanent facility had begun. </p><p>In the Second World War the track was seriously damaged, with the surface badly broken up by the passing armoured vehicles, while the wooden structures were also torn down. Nevertheless, the motorsports fans in the region were keen to get things going again, and in 1947, the Hockenheim-Ring GmbH was established to look after the economic side of the organisation. Racing resumed again in May 1947. The first German Motorcycle Grand Prix was held at Hockenheim on May 19, 1957.</p><p>The construction of the Mannheim-Walldorf autobahn forced the circuit owners to make changes, as its course sliced through the track on the edge of the town. Plans were drawn up for a new motodrome section by Ernst Christ in 1961, with the final design was configured by John Hugenholz. It boasted a new pit straight and a fan-friendly stadium section, as well as a short course and was run in a clockwise direction for the first time. Construction began in spring 1964 and on May 22, 1966, the then German Transport Minister, Dr. Hans-Christoph Seebohm, opened the new Hockenheimring for the German Motorcycle Grand Prix.</p><p>A sad chapter in the 'new' Hockenheim unfolded in spring 1968, when Jim Clark crashed to his death in a Formula Two race. A small memorial stone was laid in the forest as a tribute to the great Scot.</p><p>Construction work at the Nürburgring meant that Hockenheim played host to the German Grand Prix for Formula One in 1970. In preparation, two chicanes were inserted on the main forest straights alongside other general improvements, including the erection of metal barriers around the circuit perimeter. In comparison with the Nordschleife, racers of the day found Hockenheim to be rather soulless and unexciting.</p><p>Minor changes were made to the circuit during the 1980s and 1990s: a chicane was inserted at Ostkurve in 1982, not far from the spot where Patrick Depailler had suffered a fatal crash two years earlier, although this was not used by the motorcycle racers. A rather clumsy affair, it was to provide a notorious encounter in that year's Grand Prix, when Nelson Piquet collided with hapless backmarker Eliseo Salazar and promptly engaged in a bout of kick boxing on live TV... The motorcycle racers continued to use the original Ostkurve as before.</p><p>By 1992, a slightly improved Ostkurve chicane was built (again bypassed by the two-wheeled racers) and in 1994 the remaining chicanes were tightened in time for the Grand Prix, though the original variants were retained for bike racing.</p><p>In 1999, plans were announced for a wholesale revision to the circuit. The FIA had demanded changes if Hockenheim was to retain the Grand Prix. At 6.8km it was felt to be too long and with large parts heading through forest sections it was not a spectator-friendly facility. A public consultation was held and several layouts discussed, with the aim of creating more overtaking possibilities.</p><p>On December 21, 2001, Hockenheim-Ring GmbH received approval for the project, and work began on February 4, 2002. The Hermann Tilke-penned revisions cost 62 million Euros and boasted impressive new grandstands which boosted capacity from 83,000 to 120,000. In deference to the public financing which had supported the renovations, the official name of the circuit was changed to Hockenheimring Baden-Württemberg at this time.</p><p>The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Nordkurve (first turn). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. The old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events. As the years pass by, only the line in the trees gives any evidence that a circuit ever passed through the forest.</p><p>The new circuit has proved generally good for racing, with a number of overtaking spots, but many lamented the loss of the long lazy straights, which marked out the old circuit as something different from the rest of the modern facilities.</p><p>Ironically, the cost of these revisions put a severe financial strain on the circuit finances. Similar problems were being experienced by the Nürburgring, so the two circuits agreed to share the F1 round, alternating hosting each year, starting with the Nürburgring in 2007.</p><p>Even this did not stem the losses, and the circuit posted losses for each Formula One event staged of up to 5.3 million Euro, which had to be covered by the regional government. With the German Grand Prix in danger of disappearing altogether, a new contract to 2018 was agreed with Formula One Administration, with FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs, but even this did not stem the tide.  From 2015 the German Grand Prix was dropped altogether and it is doubtful if it will return unless the financial arrangements for hosting Grands Prix fundamentally changes.</p></div>
