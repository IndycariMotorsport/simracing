            <div style="font-size: 15px"><p>A classic road racing course nestling in the rolling countryside at Lexington, Mid-Ohio grew from relatively modest origins to become one of the most significant circuits in America. With its lush green surroundings and challenging layout, Mid-Ohio is a firm favourite of both competitors and spectators alike.</p><p>The track was the brainchild of Les Griebling, who convinced a number of friends from the local business community to invest in a road course for weekend sportscar racing. A few hundred acres of pasture in northwest Morrow County were quickly identified as a suitable site and ground was broken in 1961. By the following year, a challenging course designed by Griebling was ready for action.</p><p>"A lot of people were building courses and I said we'll build one that's a little better," said Griebling. "I wanted it to be difficult and it came out my way. It's very interesting because the driver is busy all the time."</p><p>By following the contours of the land, a series of twisting and plunging corners was created, linked by a fast kinked back straight. Two signature corners - the Keyhole and the the Carousel - provided additional challenges for drivers and riders.  The original course was mildly modified earlier in 1963 to address concerns raised by the drivers that it was too slow;  Oak Tree Bend (which as its name suggestions, wound around an oak tree) was removed and the Thunder Valley section added in its place.  Some small traces of tarmac from the original bend remain today within the infield.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, the circuit continued under Griebling's control, with a variety of categories making it a regular stop on their schedules. Can-Am and F5000 all raced here, with notable names such as Denis Hulme, Peter Revson, Bruce McClaren, George Follmer and Jackie Stewart all coming to north central Ohio to sample its unique challenge. CART Indycars arrived in 1980, with Johnny Rutherford taking victory in the Chaparral.</p><p>In 1981, Jim Trueman - founder of the Red Roof Inns restaurant change - purchased the facility from Griebling and his fellow investors and set about transforming the track. Trueman was himself a road racer of note and was convinced that Mid-Ohio could become one of the USA's premier racing venues.</p><p>Under his direction, the track underwent major renovations, including the addition of permanent grandstands, amphitheatre-style seating, garages with viewing balconies and several buildings such as the iconic Goodyear Tower and a redesigned paddock area.</p><p>In 1985, Trueman's own Truesports team won the Indycar event in the hands of Bobby Rahal, a feat repeated the following year in emotional circumstances, coming a month after Trueman's death from cancer.</p><p>Trueman's wife Barbara and daughter Michelle undertook management of the facility in 1986, continuing track improvements throughout the decade with the resurfacing and widening of the entire course, as well as the addition of safety enhancements such as tyre, guardrail, sand and cement barriers, spectator and debris fencing, and gravel runoff areas.</p><p>Part of these changes included the construction in 1990 of a new link road through the chicane, creating a longer straight from Turn One to the Keyhole. This variation of the track was generally preferred for major series races, including the Indycars, from then on.</p><p>In 2006, the track again underwent extensive renovation. The track and pit lane were completely resurfaced, removing the concrete patches from the turns and installing standardised kerbing across the whole course. New link roads were also added in the track's famed Keyhole section to allow for three separate road course configurations, two of which could be run concurrently.</p><p>On March 2, 2011, it was announced that the track had been purchased from Truesports by Green Savoree Racing Promotions, which currently also promotes the Indycar street courses at St Petersburg and Toronto, ending Truesports' 29 years of ownership.</p><p>Today's racing schedule includes the Honda Indy 200 event, a round of the NASCAR Nationwide series, AMA Pro Racing and vintage motorcycle and car events in a compact calendar run between June and August. The circuit is also home to the Mid-Ohio School, which was found in 1993 to offer licensed drives and motorcycle riders programs in defensive driving, high performance driving and performance track riding.</p></div>

            ROAD ATLANTA

            <div style="font-size: 13px"><p>Road Atlanta, located in Braselton, Georgia, is home to the famed Petit Le Mans, a 10-hour, 1,000-mile event that has annually drawn the biggest names and cars in sportscar racing. That such an event should find a home deep in stockcar racing's heartland is perhaps a surprise, but Road Atlanta has established a rich road racing heritage, right from its earliest days.</p><p>The 12-turn track was the brainchild of David Sloyer, Earl Walker and Arthur Montgomery, who conceived the sprawling facility on a 750-acre tract of land in Hall County. Work began in 1969 and continued into the following year. As work progressed on the $1.3million facility, Road Atlanta got its first big break, when the Can-Am Championship announced that the new facility would replace flood damaged Bridgehampton in September.</p><p>The rush was on to complete the circuit in time but, remarkably, the track emerged from the red Georgia clay in just six months. When the excavation, grading and surfacing was complete, a fast and challenging road racing circuit lay in wait for the Can-Am stars – possibly one of the best in North Amercia.</p><p>From the start, the lap climbed uphill through the sweeping first turn to a series of esses which guided the cars along a snake-like course to the foot of the hill, before a further climb took drivers through a series of turns onto the long back straight. This plunged downhill through a compression before swinging to the left and uphill, turning right through a cutting and under a bridge in dramatic style, before then careening back downhill through a high speed right-hander and back to the start.</p><p>The first race was held on September 13, 1970. Vic Elford, in a Chaparral 2J, won pole and Tony Dean, in a Porsche 908/02, won the 300 km Can-Am event, with Stirling Moss as the Grand Marshal. A huge crowd gathered to watch the most sophisticated cars of the day turn 75 laps on the brand new circuit.</p><p>Through the 1970s, the circuit continued to thrive, with Can-Am returning and visits from Formula 5000, IMSA Camel GT and Trans Am, as well as several SCCA events - including the annual Valvoline Runoffs - all helping to bolster the racing calendar. Even NASCAR paid a visit, with the Camaros, Mustangs and Firebirds, of the Grand American division taking part in the Lanier 250 in May of 1973. Among the drivers that day was the moustachioed Amercian comedian Dick Smothers, co-driving in John Greenwood's Chevrolet.</p><p>Road Atlanta was sold in 1978 and went through a number of owners in a short period of time, creating a downward spiral of the track's fortunes. Racing continued much as it always had, but it was clear that money was lacking for any significant improvements. Safety, in particular through the dip at the end of the back straight, was becoming marginal as speeds grew ever higher.</p><p>The only significant change through the 1980s was the insertion of a chicane along the back straight, though it only seems to have seen serious competiton use for the during the 1992 Valvoline National Championship Runoffs, though it may have been is use for karts or motorcycles at the time. In any case, it did not find favour and was itself eventually removed.</p><p>By 1993 things had come to a head under the ownership of the Whittington brothers and the track entered into bankruptcy. A partnership between business executives Frank Drendel, Jim Kanely, Eddie Edwards and Bill Waddell was formed to purchase the track. The next three years saw gradual improvements made, including building renovations, a track widening and resurfacing project and landscaping of the ground. But the owners lacked the kind of capital that could return Road Atlanta to its glory days and overcome the previous decade's lack of investment.</p><p>Enter Dr. Don Panoz. The developer of the nicotine patch and founder of neighboring Chateau Elan Winery and Resort, Panoz got into the automotive field when his son Danny began producing the Panoz Roadster. The elder Panoz realized what great potential Road Atlanta possessed and bought the facility in November 1996.</p><p>He hired Bob Barnard, who had cut his teeth designing the Adelaide Grand Prix circuit among other ventures, and tasked him with redesigning the course and facilities. At the end of 1997, construction began on a new left-right chicane section at the end of the back straight, designed to elimate the infamous dip and slow speeds under the bridge. At the same time, new short and club courses were constructed and miles of concrete barriers and runoff areas installed. A 100 foot tunnel also improved infield access, while renovated garages graced the pitlane.</p><p>More ambitious plans to build a complete new pit and paddock area on the opposite side of the track formed phase two of the $6million renovations. The new pitlane was incomplete by the start of the racing season and would be finished part way through 1998.</p><p>The track's signature event was born when Panoz announced he had agreement to host Le Mans style racing under IMSA auspices that October. The 10 hour or 1,000 mile race was dubbed the Petit Le Mans and attracted the crème of sportscar racing for a season finale. That first race was memorable for many reasons, not least the spectacular backflip made by the pole winning Porsche as it passed behind a lapped car over the hump on the backstretch. The car was destroyed, but driver Yannick Dalmas emerged unscathed. The race was won by Wayne Taylor, Eric Van de Poele and Emmanuel Collard in a Ferrari 333SP in the GT1 class, and the event became an instant classic.</p><p>The next year, Panoz became one of the founders of the American Le Mans Series, and the Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta became one of the highlights of the series calendar, always attracting additional overseas visitors for the season finale.</p><p>Changes continued apace and in 2003 a new complex featuring a flip-flop chicane was inserted at Turn 3 for the exclusive use of motorcycle racing. It drew a mixed response from riders.</p><p>Prior to the 2007 Petit Le Mans, the entire track surface was repaved. The works also included moving the walls in the Esses away from the track, with the intention of improved driver safety and better sight lines for spectators.</p><p>More extensive alterations came in 2008, aimed at further improving safety for motorcycle racers. An auxiliary Turn 12, offering a safer and slower transition to the start-finish line straight was created, requiring considerable excavation and a realignment of the original pit lane entry. Elsewhere, a second chicane was inserted at Turn 4 ahead of the Esses, resulting in a different racing line and additional runoff room.</p><p>The riders greeted the new Turn 12 with some enthusiasm but the same could not be said for the Turn 4 chicane. While many thought it was a fun challenge to ride over a single lap, all felt it would be unsuitable for racing and could actually cause more problems that it solved. In the end, it has never been used in anger.</p><p>In September 2012, the track was purchased by NASCAR as part of its acquisition of Panoz Motorsports group. The Petit Le Mans has continued on under NASCAR's ownership, this time as the showpiece event of the unified United SportsCar Championship. Stock car racing has also made its return, with Road Atlanta added to the NASCAR K&N East development series from 2013 onwards.</p><p>The little-used and troublesome Turn 4 chicane was elminated and grassed over as part of general circuit improvements for the 2017 season, returning the track to its 2003 layout variations.</p></div>
